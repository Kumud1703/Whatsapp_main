## Fortified by Firebase Firestore 🌐

At the heart of WhatsUp is the mighty Firebase Firestore. We rely on Firestore to securely save user data and facilitate seamless message transmission. Each message sent by a user is immediately whisked away to Firestore, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery. Notably, messages sent are promptly removed from Firestore as soon as they are received by the recipient's device, enhancing privacy and security.

## Your Privacy, Our Priority 🛡️

In WhatsUp, messages within a chat are stored exclusively on the phones of the communicating individuals. This design ensures that your conversations remain private and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. Your messages are your own, and we're committed to keeping it that way.

## The Future is Exciting 🌟

Exciting enhancements await us on the horizon, including:

- **Voice & Video Calling** Connect face-to-face or chat with your voice using our intuitive video and voice calling features.
